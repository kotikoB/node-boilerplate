# node-boilerplate
No need to spend precious amounts of time doing repetitive tasks. node-boilerplate gives you an easy and minimalistic
boilerplate to kickstart your project and get you up and running as quick as possible, complete with authentication, authorization
form input validation and access control.
## Assumptions

Notwithstanding, this boilerplate is also usable with other databases and ORMs e.g MySQL with sequelize.
If you wish to use another database, go to the index.js file and edit the connection string to match your specific database,
then go into the models folder and tweak it accordingly.

1. Clone or download
2. Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies
3. Navigate to .env file in the root directory and edit mogodb connection string and 
4. Code away. Enjoy!
